Fix bug with surface at front of test level being removed
    first appears at "cleaning up code 7"
	hole is triangle shape, vertex index is missing?
	already like this *before* cleanup
		why is this triangulated incorrectly?
			should just be triangular hole
		why is the vertex index missing?
			when was this introduced?
Get rid of loop.indices
all the places we need worldplanes, use precalculated brushWorldPlanes
somehow remove need for "destroyed" bool array in Loop
somehow store edges in NativeList so we never have to convert
replace bounds with own implementation that doesn't use properties & uses unity.mathematics

indices used in
   CalculatePlane
   AreLoopsOverlapping
   PerformBooleanIntersection
   class IntersectionLoop

remove somehow (slow)
	SortIndices
	IsPointInPolygon
