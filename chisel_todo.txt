produce blobAssets at different phases as output, use as input in next phase
	only update these blobAssets when necessary
	removes need to store things in 'Loops' etc.
all the places we need worldplanes, use precalculated brushWorldPlanes
somehow remove need for "destroyed" bool array in Loop
replace bounds with own implementation that doesn't use properties & uses unity.mathematics

producing brushMesh assets is slow
	this in a job somehow

remove somehow (slow)
	SortIndices
	IsPointInPolygon
